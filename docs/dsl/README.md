**LogicPuzzles – Project Brief**

**Purpose**
LogicPuzzles explores single‑player, grid‑based NP‑complete puzzles (e.g., Sudoku, Kakuro, Unruly, Nurikabe, etc...). The goal is to understand, formalize, and extend these puzzles, ultimately building a meta‑system that can create new rule‑sets, generate engaging puzzles, and synthesize solvers and human‑readable tactics automatically.

**High‑Level Goals**
• **Formal Specification** – Express existing and novel puzzle rules in a declarative, solver‑friendly language (SMT).
• **Solver Synthesis** – Automatically derive complete SMT models and efficient solving algorithms for any given ruleset.
• **Puzzle Generation** – Produce high‑quality instances on demand, including random generation and difficulty scaling.
• **Tactic Discovery** – Mine solver traces to distill human‑understandable solving techniques.
• **Meta‑Generation** – Search the space of puzzle specifications to invent fresh, enjoyable puzzle families, together with their generators and solvers.
• **Fun Analysis** – Develop quantitative heuristics that correlate with human enjoyment and difficulty.

**Project Scope**
The work spans three mutually‑reinforcing layers:

1. **Rulesets** – Specification, mutation, and evaluation of puzzle rule spaces.
2. **Solvers & Tactics** – SMT‑based solving pipelines; extraction of reusable tactics and strategy libraries.
3. **Meta‑Pipeline** – An end‑to‑end framework that, given a (possibly generated) ruleset, emits:
   • a verified SMT formalization;
   • a puzzle generator capable of adjustable difficulty.
   • an automated solver;
   • A user-friendly GUI that can solve puzzles.

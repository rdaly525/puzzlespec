# This puzzlespec DSL allows users to write a formal puzzle spec for grid-based logic puzzles


There are 3 kinds of parameters/variables:

1) Structural/User parameters: These are chosen by the user and become constants at puzzle generation time
2) Generator Parameters/Variables: These are solved for by the generator and are constants at puzzle solving time
3) Decision variables: There are two flavors of this 


Ideas for DSL:
    I want to be able to programatically encode Grid-like puzzles using a DSL.
